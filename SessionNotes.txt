ERD => Entity relationship Diagram
Entity => course , teacher , student => attributes

employee (strong entity)  => dependants  (week entity)

arrributes 
key attribute => primary key 
multivalued attribute => has more than value => phone , address
composite attribute => divided to small parts (name=> first name,lastname)
derived attribute=> attributed calculated from another attribute=> age , birthdate => 15/1/2000
 simple attribute => gender


Realtionship => degree , cardinality ratio

degree => binary => two entities 
    => unary relation => entity and it self
    => ternary relation => between more than two entities

emplyee        supervisor (employee)

cardinality ration => 
one to one => only one of entity deal with only one
one to many=> only one of entity deal with many
many to many=> many of entity deal with many





---------------------- mapping ERD
multi valued attribute => new table

 one to many => primary key of one => put as => foreign key in many

one to one => primary key of must => put as => foreign key in  may
many to many => new table => has primary key of each entity as a foreign key


CREATE table department(id integer PRIMARY key AUTO_INCREMENT ,name varchar (255) UNIQUE );

CREATE table project(id integer PRIMARY key AUTO_INCREMENT ,name varchar (255) UNIQUE, department_id);

alter table project add CONSTRAINT kf_dp_id FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES department (id);
